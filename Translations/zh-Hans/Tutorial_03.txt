Here we go! There is no round in which you won't have to use SCP-914. It's a special machine that allows you to change the access level of your keycards. Please enter the containment chamber.
Look at the panel with the knob. It can be turned into 5 different positions.
1:1 - changes the type of a keycard. For instance:\nthe Scientist keycard to a Guard keycard;\nor an MTF commander keycard to a Containment engineer keycard
Fine - increases the level of the card, and Coarse - decreases it.
Very fine and Rough are equivalents of Fine and Coarse. They're faster, but more risky.
Tutorial3_GiveKeycard
I just threw you a card somewhere on the floor.\nPick it up and try to upgrade it to the highest level - the O5 Keycard.
<color=#00FF58>Set the knob to <b>Fine, Very fine or 1:1</b> to upgrade the keycard.
What have you done? I didn't expect this... there's nothing interesting, go back to SCP-914!
You did something wrong and you burned it. No problem, take another one.
Oh, you did it again! Come on! Take the next one.
You know what? Maybe I will give you 5 keycards for once?\nRemember, we want O5-level keycard, no ash.
Ehh, you are doing it on purpose. Do you think this is funny? You know what I can do, and you can't prevent? Quitting the game! Yeah! Come back later when you a little smarter!
Tutorial3_Quit
Well done! With this card can enter anywhere! I see that you understand what SCP-914 is. I hope you will be able to use the acquired skills in normal gameplay. Good luck!

Welcome to SCP: Secret Laboratory! I'm one of the voice actors for the game.\nLet me introduce you to basic gameplay rules.\nTry to find and check toilets in order to find a potential keycard.\n
<color=#00FF58>Use <b>W, A, S & D</b> in order to go to the <b>toilets</b>\nUse <b>E</b> to <b>interact</b> with doors and items.</color>
Great, now take it.
Keycards are one of the most basic elements of the game, allowing entrance to locked areas.\nCheck the nearby doors and try to open them with your card.
<color=#00FF58>Use <b>TAB</b> to open inventory.\n<b>Left mouse button</b> to select item\nand <b>right</b> to drop it.
If you really want to escape - I'd suggest finding a better card.
Every card has its own access levels. You can compare cards by hovering your mouse cursor over each one in your inventory.
Congratulations! You just passed the first part of the tutorial!

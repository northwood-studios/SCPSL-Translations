# SCPSL Translations   
This repo is used by Northwood Studios for hosting and managing translations for the SCP: Secret Laboratory game.   

In the case where a bad/faulty translation of your chosen language already exists, we ask you to rather edit the current existing one, than adding another duplicate language.

* Do **not** submit a language that already exists.
* Do **not** submit a made-up/joke language.
* Do **not** remove contributers from the contributors file.

__Please follow these rules, as well as the guidelines in the Pull Request template__
